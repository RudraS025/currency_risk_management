# Currency Risk Management System - Complete P&L Guide

## üéØ Quick Summary: What P&L Means for You

**P&L (Profit & Loss)** shows how currency exchange rate changes affect your money. 

### In Simple Terms:
- **You export goods** ‚Üí Get paid in USD
- **USD exchange rate changes** ‚Üí Your INR value changes
- **P&L calculation** ‚Üí Shows how much you gain/lose

## üìä Your Current Situation (Live Example)

**Your Paddy Export to Iran:**
- LC Amount: $100,000 USD
- Signed 30 days ago at: ‚Çπ85.36 per USD
- Current rate: ‚Çπ85.72 per USD
- **Result: You're gaining ‚Çπ35,570** (USD got stronger!)

## üßÆ How P&L is Calculated

### The Formula:
```
Current Value = USD Amount √ó Current Rate
Signing Value = USD Amount √ó Signing Rate
P&L = Current Value - Signing Value
```

### Your Example:
```
Current Value = $100,000 √ó 85.72 = ‚Çπ85,71,700
Signing Value = $100,000 √ó 85.36 = ‚Çπ85,36,130
P&L = ‚Çπ85,71,700 - ‚Çπ85,36,130 = +‚Çπ35,570
```

## ‚úÖ What Different Results Mean

| P&L Result | What Happened | Impact on You |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Positive (+)** | USD strengthened | You get MORE INR |
| **Negative (-)** | USD weakened | You get LESS INR |
| **Zero (0)** | No change | Same INR value |

## üìä Real Calculation Example

Let's say you want to check a different LC:

```python
# Create your LC
lc = LetterOfCredit(
    lc_id="YOUR-LC-001",
    commodity="Your Product",
    quantity=500,
    unit="tons", 
    rate_per_unit=200,  # $200 per ton = $100,000 total
    currency="USD",
    signing_date="2025-05-01",  # When you signed
    maturity_days=90,
    customer_country="Your Country",
    incoterm="FOB"
)

# Calculate P&L
pl_calculator = ProfitLossCalculator()
result = pl_calculator.calculate_current_pl(lc, "INR")

# Check your result
print(f"Your P&L: ‚Çπ{result['unrealized_pl']:,.2f}")
```

## üîç Understanding the Code

The P&L calculation happens in:
- **File**: `src/currency_risk_mgmt/calculators/profit_loss.py`
- **Function**: `calculate_current_pl()`
- **Process**: 
  1. Gets historical rate for signing date
  2. Gets current live rate
  3. Calculates INR values
  4. Computes difference = P&L

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Monitor Daily**: Check P&L every day
2. **Set Alerts**: Get notified when P&L changes significantly
3. **Track Trends**: Look for patterns in currency movements
4. **Plan Hedging**: Decide in advance when to hedge
5. **Keep Records**: Document all P&L decisions
