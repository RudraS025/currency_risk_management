## üßÆ Step-by-Step Calculation

### 1. Original Value Calculation:
```
Original Value = USD Amount √ó Signing Rate
‚Çπ34,499,679.57 = $400,000 √ó ‚Çπ86.2492
```

### 2. Current Value Calculation:

Current Value = USD Amount √ó Current Rate
‚Çπ34,286,801.15 = $400,000 √ó ‚Çπ85.7170
```

### 3. Unrealized Loss Calculation:
```
Unrealized Loss = Current Value - Original Value
‚Çπ-212,878.42 = ‚Çπ34,286,801.15 - ‚Çπ34,499,679.57
```

### 4. P&L Percentage Calculation:
```
P&L % = (Unrealized Loss √∑ Original Value) √ó 100
-0.62% = (‚Çπ-212,878.42 √∑ ‚Çπ34,499,679.57) √ó 100
